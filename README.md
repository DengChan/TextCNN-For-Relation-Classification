# TextCNN-For-Relation-Classification
## Introduction
An implementation for Relation Classification using textCNN 

Most part of code refers to  [roomylee](https://github.com/roomylee/cnn-relation-extraction),a little modification have been made to adapt current version of tensorflow.

The model is descriped as below in Paper [Relation Extraction: Perspective from Convolutional Neural Networks](https://cs.nyu.edu/~thien/pubs/vector15.pdf)

To make the actual algorithm clear, I would like to present you this picture:

## Usage
### Requirements
* Tensorflow-1.11
* scikit-learn

### Train
* The train data is located in "SemEval2010_task8_all_data/SemEval2010_task8_training/TRAIN_FILE.TXT".
* ["GoogleNews-vectors-negative300"](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) is used as pre-trained word embeddings.Or you can get it at [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XuzfjBYIdye_UXytpv9qug]) , 2muq
* The parameters setting is located in configure.py.You can get help by command 
` python train --help `
* To run :
`python train (--[parameter_name] [value])`

### Evaluation
* Test data is located in "SemEval2010_task8_all_data/SemEval2010_task8_testing_keys/TEST_FILE_FULL.TXT".
* Parameter **checkpoint_dir** and the vacab_to_index,pos_to_index json file(generated by train step) paths **text_tokenizer_path**、**pos_tokenizer_path** must be given.Just like below:

```
python eval.py --checkpoint_dir "runs/1523902663/checkpoints/" --text_tokenizer_path "runs/1523902663/checkpoints/text_tokenizer.json --pos_tokenizer_path "runs/1523902663/checkpoints/pos_tokenizer.json"
```

### Result
* Use macro average F1 score and Accuracy to evaluate the performance.
* I got a F1 score of 74.85% and the accuracy is 76% by using default settings
* Used dropout and l2 regularization , but overfitting is still a big problem .
* The best performance may reach 82% for F1, you can adjust the parameters to get better performance .
